Here's a sample **README.md** file for your **Hash Buster** project that can be uploaded to GitHub:

# Hash Buster

**Hash Buster** is a Python-based tool for cracking and bypassing various types of hashes such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512. This tool uses several online and local APIs to reverse the hash back to its original plaintext. It supports both single hash cracking and batch processing of multiple hashes.

## Features
- Supports common hash algorithms: **MD5**, **SHA1**, **SHA256**, **SHA384**, and **SHA512**.
- Batch mode for processing multiple hashes from a file or directory.
- Multithreading support to speed up the hash-cracking process.
- Fetches hash results from multiple online databases.
- Easy to use with command-line arguments for hash cracking.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `argparse`
  - `re`
  - `concurrent.futures`
  - `os`

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

### Single Hash Mode
You can provide a single hash directly via the `-s` argument:
```bash
python3 hash.py -s <hash_value>
```

Example:
```bash
python3 hash.py -s 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
```

### Batch Mode (File)
You can provide a file containing multiple hashes via the `-f` argument:
```bash
python3 hash.py -f <file_path>
```

Example:
```bash
python3 hash.py -f hashes.txt
```

### Batch Mode (Directory)
You can provide a directory containing multiple files with hashes via the `-d` argument:
```bash
python3 hash.py -d <directory_path>
```

Example:
```bash
python3 hash.py -d /path/to/directory
```

### Multithreading
To specify the number of threads for hash processing, use the `-t` argument:
```bash
python3 hash.py -f hashes.txt -t 8
```

### Output
- Results will be printed on the terminal and saved to a file if multiple hashes are processed.
- For file input, cracked hashes are saved to `cracked-<file_name>.txt`.

## Example
```bash
python3 hash.py -f example_hashes.txt -t 4
```

### Supported Hash Types
- MD5 (32 characters)
- SHA1 (40 characters)
- SHA256 (64 characters)
- SHA384 (96 characters)
- SHA512 (128 characters)
